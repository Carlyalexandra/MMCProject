            <li> 8,000 tonnes of wrapping paper is used each year -- the equivalent of approximately 50,000 trees.

            With more than 7 billion people consuming, and then disposing of, "stuff" each day, usable space for trash disposal is quickly disappearing. <br>
          <br>
            Earth's refuse waistband pulls particularly taught in major cities, where people coalesce in limited space. The World Bank estimates that 3 billion people reside within urban areas, producing more than 1.3 billion metric tons of solid waste per year. By 2025 that number is expected to balloon to more than 2.2 billion metric tons, forcing governments to task on a garbage problem that many major cities have yet to answer. <br><br>

            Increases in risk of adverse health effects (low birth weight, birth defects, certain types of cancers) have been reported near individual landfill sites and in some multisite studies, and although biases and confounding factors cannot be excluded as explanations for these findings, they may indicate real risks associated with residence near certain landfill sites. A general weakness in the reviewed studies is the lack of direct exposure measurement. An increased prevalence of self-reported health symptoms such as fatigue, sleepiness, and headaches among residents near waste sites has consistently been reported in more than 10 of the reviewed papers. It is difficult to conclude whether these symptoms are an effect of direct toxicologic action of chemicals present in waste sites, an effect of stress and fears related to the waste site, or an effect of reporting bias. <br>
