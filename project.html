			<h2 id="title3">How to Reduce Household Food Waste</h2>
			<div class="byline">by Melissa Lin, Friday 6/6/14</div>
			<div class="bodyp">
			<p>
			Food is too important, and delicious, to waste. Even the most sustainably farmed food does us no good if it&apos;s wasted. Getting food to table eats up 10 percent of the total U.S. energy budget, uses 50 percent of U.S. land and swallows 80 percent of fresh water consumed, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).
			</p>
			<p>
			Yet, 40 percent of food in the United States goes uneaten &ndash; more than 20 pounds of food per person per month, the equivalent of $165 billion annually, according to the NRDC.
			</p>
			<p>
			Most of this uneaten food ends up buried and rotting in landfills, where organic matter accounts for 16 percent of U.S. methane emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
			</p>
			<p>
			Nutrition also is lost, as food saved by reducing losses by just 15 percent could feed more than 25 million Americans annually.

			<h2 id="title2">Don&apos;t Buy the Advertising Hype for These Products</h2>
			<div class="byline">by Carly Rosenberg, Friday 5/30/14</div>
			<div class="bodyp">
			<p>
			Madison Avenue&apos;s stealth use of labels to market everything from cologne to jeans has been co-opted by K Street. Candidates are elected or not based on catchy labels produced by pundits, political advisers and marketing agencies. Flip-flopper, insider, outsider, moderate, pro-choice, pro-family, flaming liberal, bleeding heart, ultraconservative and hawk are among the empty tags we affix to Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Greens and Cool Moose.
			</p>
			<p>
			Candidates are seldom elected based on their ideas, honesty, integrity and intellect. The same could be said for many of our purchases. Advertisers spent $144 billion in 2011 to entice us to buy more and more stuff, much of it unnecessary and bad for public health and the environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			The following is a list of some products you don&apos;t need, but are advertised as if they are essential to our existence:
			</p>
			<p>
			Bottled water. Americans buy half a billion bottles of water weekly. Many people buy bottled water thinking they&apos;re avoiding any contaminants that may be present in their tap water. Bottled water, however, can be just as, or even more, contaminated than tap water. In fact, some bottled water is tap water &ndash; overpriced and packaged in plastic that can leach chemicals into the water. Also, from manufacture to disposal, bottled water creates an enormous amount of pollution and waste. Our elected officials spend about $18,000 of taxpayer money annually to provide bottled water at the Statehouse. Perhaps they too should invest in reusable stainless steel water bottles.

			<h2 id="title1">Batteries: Some Hazardous, Some Trash</h2>
			<div class="byline">by Mallory Bory, Tuesday 5/27/14</div>
			<div class="bodyp">
			<p>Batteries are smaller and more powerful than ever but are not the best things for landfills, where they often end up.
			</p>
			<p>
			Rechargeable nickel, cadmium and lithium batteries, like those used in cell phones and laptop computers, are hazardous waste and should be kept out of the trash and recycle bins. Fortunately, battery collection recepticles can be found at most municipal transfer stations and public works offices. The Eco-Depot at the central landfill in Johnston also accepts rechargable batteries during regular business hours and on most Saturdays. Private recyclers such as Green Penguin and Indie Cycle also will take batteries during frequent e-waste collection events.
			</p>
			<p>
			The state has no recycling program for alkaline batteries, like those used in flashlights, toys and digital cameras. Some cities and towns, however, work with private waste haulers to collect and recycle spent batteries, usually through a bin at a transfer station.
